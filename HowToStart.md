The Arduino
First off all.. You'll have to get a hold of an Arduino itself. I've ordered my Arduino Diecemila through a dutch webshop called "http://www.eztronics.nl/".

The RF-shield
Next thing is to order the components to build a RF shield. I've bought prototyping shields and components from different suppliers. The prototyping shield will stack on top of the Arduino and connect the various components to the Arduino input/output-pins.
This type of shields van be used: "http://www.eztronics.nl/webshop/catalog/product_info.php/products_id/181".

The other components i've used to build the RF shield are:
**RX433 (http://www.okaphone.com/artikel.asp?id=137001)** TX433 (http://www.okaphone.com/artikel.asp?id=129469)
**resistors** led
**pot-meter** wire

By using solder and a solderingiron you can build the shield yourself.

I've also bought myself super-het versions of the receiver. Hopefully using this receiver, i'll boost the receiving-range. I bought this module through internet (http://www.radiotronix.com/products/proddb.asp?ProdID=%20121). I've not tried it yet.

Development environment
I've been using the Arduino environment http://www.arduino.cc/ version 0011 on Ubuntu Linux v8.04 with JRE6.

Home Automation hardware
I've bought many cheap hardware from various suppliers. I've got Infrared-motion-detectors. Water-detectors. Remote switches. Dimmers. The URC MX 3000 remote control. A RF enabled home ventillation system.
