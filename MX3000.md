#This is a description how i modified my MX-3000 universal remote control (URC) from 418 mhz to 433 mhz.

# Introduction #

Over Ebay i bought 2 US MX-3000 remote controls. I knew that these devices would transmit RF on 418 mhz which is not compatible with european RF-devices (and regulation). At first i wanted to construct a tranceiver which would receive on 418 mhz and retransmit the signals on 433 mhz.
Eventually i decived that it would be just too much work and not stable enough and decided to open up the remotes and modificate the remote.
I bought a few crystals of Ebay. Desoldered the originally mounted crystal. Pried open the casing of the remote. Isolated the new crystal. Soldered the connection. And voila.

I will finish this text soon and also place some pictures.
